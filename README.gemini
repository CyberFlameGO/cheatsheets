## Women Empowerment in Zanzibar

=> https://www.gofundme.com/f/women-empowerment-in-zanzibar GoFundMe

Send a little karma down the way and support women empowerment in Zanzibar by helping to fund the local production of reusable female hygiene products. A very dear friend of mine runs the project. They were already able to buy hundreds of educational books. Sometimes, it takes so little to make a huge impact. If you'd like to thank me or support this work, donate. Additionally, any current and future sponsoring of my work via GitHub or other channels will flow one hundred percent to the NGO.
