## Disable Jail Autostart

```
ezjail-admin config -r norun <JAIL_NAME>
```

## Set CPU Affinity

You can limit the specific cores a jail uses but not a number of automatically
scheduled ones. This can be done as a single core, a range of cores or a list
cores.

```
ezjail-admin config -c <CORE_NUMBER> <JAIL_NAME>
```

Where <CORE_NUMBER> is the core number you want your jail on, with 0 being the
first and n-1 being the last should you have n cores, and <JAIL_NAME> being the
name of the ezjail-managed jail you want to set the affinity of.

```
ezjail-admin config -c <CORE_NUMBER_FIRST>-<CORE_NUMBER_LAST> <JAIL_NAME>
```

Where <CORE_NUMBER_FIRST> and <CORE_NUMBER_LAST> are the first and last cores
you want to run on respectively, and <JAIL_NAME> being the jail name.

```
ezjail-admin config -c <CORE_NUMBER_FIRST>,<CORE_NUMBER_SECOND>,...,<CORE_NUMBER_N> <JAIL_NAME>
```

Where core numbers like <CORE_NUMBER_FIRST>, <CORE_NUMBER_LAST>, and
<CORE_NUMBER_N> are the core numbers you want to run on, and <JAIL_NAME> being
the jail name.

## Upgrade Base Jail

There's a common issue arising every release upgrade with jails created in
ezjail. The documentation is sparse in this regard. You'll know that you have a
problem when you're running into the following error message:

> /!\ ERROR: /!\
>
> Ports Collection support for your FreeBSD version has ended, and no ports are
> guaranteed to build on this system. Please upgrade to a supported release.
>
> No support will be provided if you silence this message by defining
> ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_SYSTEM.

Instead of just using the environment variable ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_SYSTEM, find
out what version of FreeeBSD you have running *inside of* the basejail:

```
grep FreeBSD_version /usr/include/sys/param.h
```

You'll get an output like the following:

```
#undef __FreeBSD_version
#define __FreeBSD_version 1101001       /* Master, propagated to newvers */
```

The first four numbers are what we're interested in, as they define the version
currently in use â€” `10.1` in this case.

Now that you know the current version in use, you need to let ezjail upgrade
*from* that version *to* the current host version. Since the kernel is shared
between the host and jails, you cannot run a newer version of FreeBSD inside a
jail than the host version.

To do so, run the following:

```
ezjail-admin update -U -s 11.1-RELEASE
```

Afterwards, restart all jails for good measure:

```
ezjail-admin restart
```

## Disable Obsolete Warning

> /etc/rc.d/jail: WARNING: Per-jail configuration via jail_* variables  is obsolete.  Please consider migrating to /etc/jail.conf.

```
sysrc jail_confwarn="NO"
```
